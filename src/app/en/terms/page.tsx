            </p>

            <h2>II. Nature of Content</h2>

            <h3>Informational Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              The content of this Site is exclusively for informational and educational
              purposes regarding topics related to urogynecology and female pelvic health.
              <strong> The information provided does not constitute, under any circumstances,
              medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Does Not Replace Medical Consultation</h3>
            <p>
              The information contained on this Site is not intended to and should not
              replace the physician-patient relationship or in-person medical consultation.
              Each patient has unique circumstances that require individualized evaluation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>For any symptoms, medical condition, or health concerns,
              you should consult directly with a qualified healthcare professional.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Emergency Situations</h3>
            <p>
              This Site is not designed to address medical emergencies. If you are
              experiencing a health emergency, you should immediately go to the nearest
              emergency room or call emergency services.
            </p>

            <h2>III. Medical Services</h2>

            <h3>Physician-Patient Relationship</h3>
            <p>
              The physician-patient relationship is established only through in-person
              consultation. Submitting information through the Site&apos;s contact form does
              not establish such a relationship and is solely intended to facilitate
              appointment requests.
            </p>

            <h3>Informed Consent</h3>
            <p>
              Prior to any diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, you will be provided with
              complete information about the nature of the procedure, its benefits, risks,
              and alternatives. Your written informed consent will be required in accordance
              with applicable regulations.
            </p>

            <h3>Medical Record</h3>
            <p>
              The medical record will be compiled and managed in accordance with Mexican
              Official Standard NOM-004-SSA3-2012, ensuring the confidentiality of your
              medical information.
            </p>

            <h3>Fees and Payments</h3>
            <p>
              Fees for medical services will be communicated prior to the consultation.
              Payment for services is the patient&apos;s responsibility, unless there is a
              specific agreement with insurance companies. Accepted payment methods will
              be communicated when scheduling your appointment.
            </p>

            <h3>Cancellations and Rescheduling</h3>
            <p>
              We request notification of cancellations or rescheduling at least 24 hours
              in advance. This allows us to offer the appointment slot to other patients
              who need care.
            </p>
